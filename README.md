# Password Complexity Checker
A password complexity checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of a password by analyzing its characteristics against predefined criteria. These criteria typically include the length of the password, the inclusion of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The checker provides feedback on whether the password meets the necessary standards for security, helping users create more robust passwords that are less susceptible to attacks such as brute force or dictionary attacks. By encouraging stronger password creation, these checkers play a crucial role in enhancing overall cybersecurity.
